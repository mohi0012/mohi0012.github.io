        <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Tultul Mohiuddin but you can call me Tula. I'm 27 and I am an illustrator, a mother to a 3 year old boy and I have a start up business! 
            I'm a student studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. One of my passions growing up was to be a graphic and web designer. 
            Throughout highschool that path changed to becoming a social worker, to help people in need of services and resources. 
            <br>
            I was truly passionate about becoming that but ultimately, I had to be true to what i wanted the most out of this life. 
            I've always been the kind of middle - woman where anyone could ask for my help and I'd help them with information, research, workshops- you name it. 
            <br>
            I decided instead that I'd voluntary do that while work and make an income as an entrepreneur and a freelancing illustrator. I was holding both worlds in my hand 
            and it's been helping me balance a lot of things in my life.</p>
        <p>My favourite things to do other than designing is to meditate, yoga sessions, teach my preschooler, and write! I write on a daily basis to get my thoughts down and my mind empty for the day.
            It helps tremendously to declutter your mind when it's so busy at work. 
            <br>
            So, I write daily entries, to do lists, and organize my agenda so I'm ontop of things. Don't worry though, I'm far from perfect. 
            But this helps me with productivity, time management, and life becomes a little easier to deal with!</p>
