        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Tultul Mohiuddin but you can call me Tula. I'm 27 and I am an illustrator, a mother to a 3 year old boy and I have a start up business! 
            I'm a 1<superscript>st</superscript> student studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College.   
            <br>
            One of my passions growing up was to be a graphic and web designer. 
            Throughout highschool that path changed to becoming a social worker, to help people in need of services and resources. 
            <br>
            I was truly passionate about becoming that but ultimately, I had to be true to what i wanted the most out of this life. 
            I've always been the kind of middle - woman where anyone could ask for my help and I'd help them with information, research, workshops- you name it.
            <br>
            I decided instead that I'd voluntary do that while work and make an income as an entrepreneur and a freelancing illustrator. I was holding both worlds in my hand 
            and it's been helping me balance a lot of things in my life.
            <hr>
            My favourite things to do other than designing is to meditate, yoga sessions, teach my preschooler, and write! I write on a daily basis to get my thoughts down and my mind empty for the day.
            It helps tremendously to declutter your mind when it's so busy at work. 
            <br>
            So, I write daily entries, to-do lists, and organize my agenda so I'm ontop of things. <em>I'm far from perfect but this helps me with productivity, time management, and life becomes a little easier to deal with!</em>
